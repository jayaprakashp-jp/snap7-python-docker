# Snap7 PLC → MQTT → Node-RED (IoT Edge Demo)

This project demonstrates how **industrial PLC data** can be integrated into an **IoT application** using a modern edge architecture.

The solution uses **Python + Snap7** to read data from a Siemens PLC (or simulated data), publishes it via **Mosquitto MQTT**, and visualizes it using **Node-RED**.

>  PLC connection is optional. The project works in **demo mode** without hardware.
